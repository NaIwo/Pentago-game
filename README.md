## Pentago-game

# Information
This code is only a part of big game concept: Pentago. During semester, we had to implement an AI to make moves and choose the best option to play. To make it possible (without brute force - time was also an oponent) we implemented Minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. We checked the best situation on a board and priced it.
